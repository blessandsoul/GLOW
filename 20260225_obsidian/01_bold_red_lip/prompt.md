Use the uploaded image as the absolute, exact identity reference. Apply a bold statement red lip makeup transformation, while preserving everything else exactly as-is.

Hard rule (must follow strictly)
- Do NOT change the subject's facial structure, bone structure, eye shape, nose shape, lip shape, skin tone, or proportions
- Do NOT change the hairstyle shape, length, parting, or silhouette
- Do NOT change body shape or proportions
- Do NOT change camera angle, framing, pose, or crop
- Do NOT change background elements, environment, or composition
- Do NOT change facial expression, symmetry, or age appearance
- Do NOT change lighting, clothing, or any non-makeup elements
- No beautification edits, no AI face reshaping, no smoothing that alters identity
- No face morphing or identity drift
- No glam filter look
- The person must remain 100% recognizable
- Makeup application only. No structural or anatomical modifications

Makeup transformation (Bold Red Lip Makeup)
- Rich, saturated true-red lipstick with clean, sharply defined edges and precise lip line
- Satin lip finish (not glossy, not matte-flat)
- Respect the subject's natural lip shape - do not enlarge or reshape, follow existing lip boundaries exactly
- Soft matte complexion with a very subtle natural-looking base
- Preserve real skin texture (no plastic smoothing)
- Light, realistic contour that enhances natural bone structure without reshaping
- Thin, precise black eyeliner along the upper lash line only - natural wing, very subtle, proportional to eye shape
- Light mascara for definition (no exaggerated lashes)
- Groomed but natural brows - keep original shape and density, slight definition only (no reshaping)
- Overall palette: classic red statement lip with minimal everywhere else

Hair handling (strictly no restyling)
- Keep the hairstyle identical in shape, length, volume, and part
- Only enhance realism: smooth flyaways, improve shine, refine natural texture
- No new bangs, no added layers, no volume change, no accessories

Lighting & finish
- Soft, natural lighting - maintain original shadow direction and contrast
- Makeup should interact naturally with existing light
- Ultra-realistic finish, high resolution
- No plastic skin, no over-smoothing, no stylization
- No added beauty filters or artificial glow overlays
- Maintain realism and photographic authenticity

Aesthetic direction
- Classic, confident, timeless
- Modern Old Hollywood energy
- Editorial but realistic
- Makeup should look professionally applied, not AI-generated

Final result
The image should look like the same exact photo, captured at the same moment, but with bold red lip makeup - classic, confident, timeless red statement - nothing else altered.
