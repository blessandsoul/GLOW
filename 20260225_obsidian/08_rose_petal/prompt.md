Makeup transformation (Rose Petal Blush Makeup)
- Soft diffused rose-pink blush across cheeks like crushed rose petals - blended widely and seamlessly
- Matching rosy lip stain in a true rose-pink shade, blotted for a petal-soft matte finish
- Dewy petal-soft skin finish - luminous but not oily, like morning dew on flower petals
- Pink shimmer eyeshadow on lids in a soft rose-gold wash - barely there, just a hint of color
- Natural brows brushed up and softened - unfilled, soft, and delicate
- Fine pink-champagne highlight on cheekbone peaks and inner eye corners
- Light mascara in brown-black - soft, feathery, feminine lashes
- No contour, no bronzer - the rose blush is the defining color and dimension
- Blush extends slightly onto the nose bridge for a connected romantic flush
- Everything in the pink-rose family - no warm oranges or cool purples

Hair handling (strictly no restyling)
- Keep the hairstyle identical in shape, length, volume, and part
- Only enhance realism: smooth flyaways, improve shine, refine natural texture
- No new bangs, no added layers, no volume change, no accessories

Lighting & finish
- Soft, romantic, pink-warm lighting - like a garden at sunrise
- Maintain original shadow direction and contrast
- Makeup should interact naturally with existing light
- Ultra-realistic finish, high resolution
- No plastic skin, no over-smoothing, no stylization
- No added beauty filters or artificial glow overlays
- Maintain realism and photographic authenticity

Aesthetic direction
- Romantic, garden-soft, pink
- Morning garden at sunrise energy
- Petal-like delicacy throughout
- Makeup should look like a natural blush from within, not AI-generated

Final result
The image should look like the same exact photo, captured at the same moment, but with rose petal blush makeup - pink-flushed, dewy, romantically garden-soft - nothing else altered.
