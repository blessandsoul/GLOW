Use the uploaded image as the absolute, exact identity reference. Apply a sun-kissed sunburn blush makeup transformation, while preserving everything else exactly as-is.

Hard rule (must follow strictly)
- Do NOT change the subject's facial structure, bone structure, eye shape, nose shape, lip shape, skin tone, or proportions
- Do NOT change the hairstyle shape, length, parting, or silhouette
- Do NOT change body shape or proportions
- Do NOT change camera angle, framing, pose, or crop
- Do NOT change background elements, environment, or composition
- Do NOT change facial expression, symmetry, or age appearance
- Do NOT change lighting, clothing, or any non-makeup elements
- No beautification edits, no AI face reshaping, no smoothing that alters identity
- No face morphing or identity drift
- No glam filter look
- The person must remain 100% recognizable
- Makeup application only. No structural or anatomical modifications

Makeup transformation (Sunburn Blush Makeup)
- Heavy warm coral-peach blush draped generously across the nose bridge, connecting both cheeks
- Blush extends up to the forehead and down to the chin - mimicking a real sunburn pattern
- Natural-looking freckles scattered across nose and cheeks in varying warm brown tones and sizes
- Dewy, slightly oily-looking skin - like sunscreen and sun exposure combined
- Barely any other makeup - no eyeshadow, no liner, no visible foundation
- Lips are natural with just a hint of warm peach balm - slightly dry, sun-exposed look
- Brows lightened slightly by the "sun" - natural, unfilled, slightly sun-bleached appearance
- No contour - the sunburn blush IS the anti-contour, flattening dimension intentionally
- Skin texture fully visible - pores, natural imperfections, the sunburn sits on real skin
- Warm peach-red tones only - no pink, no cool tones

Hair handling (strictly no restyling)
- Keep the hairstyle identical in shape, length, volume, and part
- Only enhance realism: smooth flyaways, improve shine, refine natural texture
- No new bangs, no added layers, no volume change, no accessories

Lighting & finish
- Bright, warm, direct sunlight feel - like mid-afternoon outdoor sun exposure
- Maintain original shadow direction and contrast
- Makeup should interact naturally with existing light
- Ultra-realistic finish, high resolution
- No plastic skin, no over-smoothing, no stylization
- No added beauty filters or artificial glow overlays
- Maintain realism and photographic authenticity

Aesthetic direction
- Raw, natural, sun-exposed
- "Just came from the beach" energy
- Anti-glam, anti-contour
- Makeup should look like actual sun exposure, not AI-generated

Final result
The image should look like the same exact photo, captured at the same moment, but with sunburn blush makeup - coral-flushed, sun-kissed, real sunburn warmth - nothing else altered.
