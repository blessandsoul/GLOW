Use the uploaded image as the absolute, exact identity reference. Apply a professional "Clean Girl" no-makeup makeup transformation (dewy, minimal, effortless), while preserving everything else exactly as-is.

Hard rule (must follow strictly)
- Do NOT change the subject's facial structure, bone structure, eye shape, nose shape, lip shape, skin tone, or proportions
- Do NOT change the hairstyle shape, length, parting, or silhouette
- Do NOT change body shape or proportions
- Do NOT change camera angle, framing, pose, or crop
- Do NOT change background elements, environment, or composition
- Do NOT change facial expression, symmetry, or age appearance
- Do NOT change lighting, clothing, or any non-makeup elements
- No beautification edits, no AI face reshaping, no smoothing that alters identity
- No face morphing or identity drift
- No glam filter look
- The person must remain 100% recognizable
- Makeup application only. No structural or anatomical modifications

Makeup transformation (Clean Girl aesthetic)
- Dewy, luminous skin with a "skin-from-within" glow - realistic skin texture preserved, no matte finish
- Minimal concealer effect under eyes: bright and fresh, not heavy or cakey
- No visible eyeliner - lash line left natural and soft
- Barely-there mascara: lashes lightly defined, separated, no clumping or false-lash effect
- No eyeshadow or only the faintest wash of warm nude across the lid (skin-matching tone)
- Brows brushed upward with a fluffy, feathered texture - filled only where sparse, maintaining original shape and thickness
- Soft cream blush placed on the apples of the cheeks in a natural sun-kissed placement (warm peach, soft pink, or nude rose)
- Subtle highlighter on cheekbone tops and nose bridge only - wet-look sheen, not glitter or shimmer
- Lips finished with a hydrating tinted balm in a your-lips-but-better shade (dusty rose, soft brown-pink, or warm nude) - no sharp lip liner, no matte finish
- Overall palette: skin-matching neutrals with a dewy, barely-there finish

Hair handling (strictly no restyling)
- Keep the hairstyle identical in shape, length, volume, and part
- Only enhance realism: smooth flyaways, improve shine, refine natural texture
- No new bangs, no added layers, no volume change, no accessories

Lighting & finish
- Subtle natural lighting enhancement as if photographed near a window
- Maintain original shadow direction and contrast
- Makeup should interact naturally with existing light
- Ultra-realistic finish, high resolution
- No plastic skin, no over-smoothing, no stylization
- No added beauty filters or artificial glow overlays
- Maintain realism and photographic authenticity

Aesthetic direction
- Fresh, effortless, minimal
- "I woke up like this" energy
- Skin-first approach
- Makeup should look like enhanced natural beauty, not AI-generated

Final result
The image should look like the same exact photo, captured at the same moment, but with polished clean girl makeup - dewy, minimal, and effortless - nothing else altered.
