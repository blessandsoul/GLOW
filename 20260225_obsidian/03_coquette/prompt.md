Use the uploaded image as the absolute, exact identity reference. Apply a dainty coquette balletcore makeup transformation, while preserving everything else exactly as-is.

- The person must remain 100% recognizable
- Makeup application only. No structural or anatomical modifications

Makeup transformation (Coquette Balletcore Makeup)
- Soft baby pink cream blush on the apples of cheeks AND across the nose bridge for an innocent flush
- Delicate rosy lip tint in pale ballet-pink, blotted for a soft-stain finish
- Pink shimmer on inner eye corners for a wide-eyed doe-like sparkle
- Feathery wispy lashes - natural-looking but curled, like ballet dancer lashes
- Porcelain dewy skin base with a lit-from-within luminosity, sheer coverage
- Soft pink-champagne shimmer dusted lightly across the center of the lids
- Brows brushed up and softened with a clear gel - natural, never harsh
- Tiny dab of pink highlighter on cupid's bow and chin
- No contour, no bronzer - the look is soft, not sculpted
- Overall palette stays within pink-rose-champagne tones exclusively

Hair handling (strictly no restyling)
- Keep the hairstyle identical in shape, length, volume, and part
- Only enhance realism: smooth flyaways, improve shine, refine natural texture
- No new bangs, no added layers, no volume change, no accessories

Lighting & finish
- Soft, ethereal, pinkish-warm light - like a ballet studio at sunrise
- Maintain original shadow direction and contrast
- Makeup should interact naturally with existing light
- Ultra-realistic finish, high resolution
- No plastic skin, no over-smoothing, no stylization
- No added beauty filters or artificial glow overlays
- Maintain realism and photographic authenticity

Aesthetic direction
- Dainty, delicately feminine, pink
- Ballet studio at sunrise energy
- Innocent and romantic
- Makeup should look petal-soft and natural, not AI-generated

Final result
The image should look like the same exact photo, captured at the same moment, but with coquette balletcore makeup - pink, dainty, delicately feminine - nothing else altered.
