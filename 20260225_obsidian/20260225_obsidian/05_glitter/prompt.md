Skin: preserve real skin texture with visible pores and micro-details. Remove only minor temporary blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing.

Makeup application ONLY (do not reshape any facial feature):
Soft smoky eyeshadow base in champagne and warm bronze tones, blended seamlessly with realistic gradient transitions. Fine reflective glitter layered lightly across eyelids, tasteful editorial sparkle, not chunky. Tiny rhinestone crystal accents placed at inner corners of both eyes. Full voluminous but realistic lashes aligned naturally to lash line. Lips in nude-pink satin shade with natural dimension, not overlined. Brows groomed and natural, keep original shape, slight definition only. No heavy foundation. No contour reshaping. Only the eye area is dramatically transformed. Palette: champagne-bronze-gold eye focus with neutral everything else.

Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.

Do not change the photo filter.
