## Prompt

A seamless horizontal strip of polished black obsidian stone surface viewed from directly above, natural conchoidal fracture patterns creating subtle curved texture across the surface, faint rainbow sheen where light hits the volcanic glass at certain angles (natural obsidian iridescence), the word OBSIDIAN in minimal recessed uppercase letters carved shallow into the stone surface with soft shadow, the carved letters have a slightly lighter grey tone against the black, continuous natural stone texture flowing left to right, tileable pattern, photorealistic mineral detail, 750x50 pixel extreme horizontal banner format.

## Cover Template (for all future Gemstone Packs)

Every pack in the Gemstone series uses the same cover formula:
- **Format:** 750x50 px horizontal banner
- **View:** Top-down, directly above the stone surface
- **Surface:** Polished version of the pack's gemstone (continuous, edge-to-edge)
- **Texture:** Natural mineral patterns of that specific stone
- **Text:** Pack name carved/recessed into the stone in minimal uppercase letters
- **Letter treatment:** Slightly lighter tone than the stone, soft shadow in the carve
- **Pattern:** Seamless, tileable left to right
- **Quality:** Photorealistic mineral detail
