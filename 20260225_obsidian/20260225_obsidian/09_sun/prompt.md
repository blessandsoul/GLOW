Skin: preserve real skin texture with visible pores and micro-details fully visible. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing. Dewy slightly oily-looking skin, like sunscreen and sun exposure combined.

Makeup application ONLY (do not reshape any facial feature):
Heavy warm coral-peach blush draped generously across nose bridge connecting both cheeks. Blush extends up to forehead and down to chin mimicking real sunburn pattern. Natural-looking freckles scattered across nose and cheeks in varying warm brown tones and sizes. Barely any other makeup — no eyeshadow, no liner, no visible foundation. Lips natural with just a hint of warm peach balm, slightly dry sun-exposed look. Brows natural, unfilled, slightly sun-bleached appearance. No contour. Warm peach-red tones only, no pink, no cool tones.

Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.

Do not change the photo filter.
