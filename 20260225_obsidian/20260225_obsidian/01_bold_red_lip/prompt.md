Rich saturated true-red lipstick with clean sharply defined edges following the natural lip line exactly. Satin lip finish. Thin precise black eyeliner along the upper lash line only, very subtle natural wing. Light mascara coat for definition only, no exaggerated effect. Soft matte complexion base, very subtle and natural-looking. Light realistic contour enhancing natural bone structure without reshaping.
