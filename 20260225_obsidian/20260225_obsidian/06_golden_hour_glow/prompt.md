Skin: preserve real skin texture with visible pores and micro-details. Remove only minor temporary blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing. Dewy radiant base with warm golden undertone.

Makeup application ONLY (do not reshape any facial feature):
Warm peachy-gold tones across face mimicking sunset golden hour light on skin. Bronze shimmer on cheekbones, warm golden-bronze highlight that catches light. Warm golden shimmer eyeshadow across lids in soft amber-peach, satin finish. Warm coral blush blended on cheekbones, sun-warmed peachy-golden flush. Honey-toned glossy lip, warm golden-nude with high-shine wet finish. Light golden highlight on nose bridge, forehead, and cupid's bow. Brows natural and groomed, slightly warmed with golden-brown tones. Lashes curled and coated in brown-black, warm and sun-lit looking. Entire face reads as bathed in warm sunset light, cohesive warm golden palette.

Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.

Do not change the photo filter.
