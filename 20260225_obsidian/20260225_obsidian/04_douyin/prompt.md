Skin: preserve real skin texture with visible pores and micro-details. Remove only minor temporary blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing. Dewy bright luminous base, hydrated with youthful glow.

Makeup application ONLY (do not reshape any facial feature):
Soft peachy-pink flush concentrated on center of face — cheeks, nose, chin. Fine champagne-pink aegyo-sal shimmer on under-eye puff area. Soft gradient coral lip with blurred edges, deeper coral at center fading to nothing at edges. Light pink-peach eyeshadow wash across lids with soft shimmer at center. Straight soft brows in natural gray-brown, youthful and unstructured. Single coat of curling mascara on upper lashes, cute not dramatic. Subtle highlight on nose bridge and under-eye area for brightening. No contour. Overall "bitten peach" effect, fresh and juicy.

Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.

Do not change the photo filter.
