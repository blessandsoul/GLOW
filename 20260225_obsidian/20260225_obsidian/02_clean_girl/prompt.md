Skin: preserve real skin texture with visible pores and micro-details. Remove only minor temporary blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing. Create a dewy luminous "skin-from-within" glow, hydrated and radiant but not oily.

Makeup application ONLY (do not reshape any facial feature):
Minimal concealer effect under eyes, bright and fresh, not heavy. No visible eyeliner, lash line left natural and soft. Barely-there mascara, lashes lightly defined and separated, no clumping or false-lash effect. No eyeshadow or only faintest wash of warm nude across lid. Brows brushed upward with fluffy feathered texture, filled only where sparse, maintaining original shape. Soft cream blush on apples of cheeks, warm peach or soft pink. Subtle wet-look highlighter on cheekbone tops and nose bridge only, no glitter. Lips with hydrating tinted balm in your-lips-but-better shade, dusty rose or warm nude, no sharp lip liner.

Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.

Do not change the photo filter.
