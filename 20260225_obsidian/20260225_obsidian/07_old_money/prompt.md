Skin: preserve real skin texture with visible pores and micro-details. Remove only minor temporary blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing. Soft matte satin finish, flawless but never shiny, never cakey.

Makeup application ONLY (do not reshape any facial feature):
Perfectly blended muted neutral eyeshadow in soft taupe across lid, slightly deeper in crease. Nude-rose lips in creamy matte formula, understated and perfectly even. Groomed natural brows filled with light feathered strokes only where needed, maintaining original shape. Subtle warm contour under cheekbones blended invisibly. Muted dusty rose blush barely visible, placed high on cheekbones. No shimmer, no glitter, no visible highlight — everything matte-satin and refined. Thin line of dark brown eyeliner on upper lash line blended softly, no wing. Natural-looking lashes curled and separated, never dramatic. Overall impression: expensive, effortless, understated.

Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.

Do not change the photo filter.
