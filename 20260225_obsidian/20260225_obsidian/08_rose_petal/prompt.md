Skin: preserve real skin texture with visible pores and micro-details. Remove only minor temporary blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing. Dewy petal-soft finish, luminous but not oily.

Makeup application ONLY (do not reshape any facial feature):
Soft diffused rose-pink blush across cheeks, blended widely and seamlessly. Blush extends slightly onto nose bridge for connected romantic flush. Matching rosy lip stain in true rose-pink shade, blotted for petal-soft matte finish. Pink shimmer eyeshadow on lids in soft rose-gold wash, barely there. Natural brows brushed up and softened, unfilled, delicate. Fine pink-champagne highlight on cheekbone peaks and inner eye corners. Light mascara in brown-black, soft feathery feminine lashes. No contour, no bronzer. Rose blush is the defining color and dimension. Everything in the pink-rose family, no warm oranges or cool purples.

Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.

Do not change the photo filter.
