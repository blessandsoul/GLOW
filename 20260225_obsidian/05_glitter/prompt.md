Use the uploaded image as the absolute, exact identity reference. Apply a glamorous embellished glitter eye makeup transformation, while preserving everything else exactly as-is.

Hard rule (must follow strictly)
- Do NOT change the subject's facial structure, bone structure, eye shape, nose shape, lip shape, skin tone, or proportions
- Do NOT change the hairstyle shape, length, parting, or silhouette
- Do NOT change body shape or proportions
- Do NOT change camera angle, framing, pose, or crop
- Do NOT change background elements, environment, or composition
- Do NOT change facial expression, symmetry, or age appearance
- Do NOT change lighting, clothing, or any non-makeup elements
- No beautification edits, no AI face reshaping, no smoothing that alters identity
- No face morphing or identity drift
- No glam filter look
- The person must remain 100% recognizable
- Makeup application only. No structural or anatomical modifications

Makeup transformation (Glitter Eye Makeup)
- Soft smoky eyeshadow base using champagne and warm bronze tones, blended seamlessly with realistic gradient transitions (no harsh digital edges)
- Fine reflective glitter layered lightly across the eyelids - tasteful, editorial sparkle, not chunky festival glitter
- Tiny rhinestone/crystal accents placed precisely at the inner corners of both eyes
- Full, dramatic lashes - voluminous but realistic, aligned naturally to lash line
- Subtle soft-focus skin finish - retain natural texture, pores must remain visible
- Lips in a nude-pink satin shade with natural dimension (not overlined, no shape change)
- Brows groomed and natural - keep original shape, slight definition only
- No heavy foundation - skin texture fully preserved under the glam
- No contour reshaping - only the eye area is dramatically transformed
- Overall palette: champagne-bronze-gold eye focus with neutral everything else

Hair handling (strictly no restyling)
- Keep the hairstyle identical in shape, length, volume, and part
- Only enhance realism: smooth flyaways, improve shine, refine natural texture
- No new bangs, no added layers, no volume change, no accessories

Lighting & finish
- Maintain the original lighting, shadows, and environment exactly as in the uploaded image
- Maintain original shadow direction and contrast
- Makeup should interact naturally with existing light
- Ultra-realistic finish, high resolution
- No plastic skin, no over-smoothing, no stylization
- No added beauty filters or artificial glow overlays
- Maintain realism and photographic authenticity

Aesthetic direction
- Editorial, luxurious, stage-ready glam
- Inspired by bold pop performance makeup (Chappell Roan energy)
- Confident, dramatic, but still elegant
- Makeup should look professionally applied, not AI-generated

Final result
The image should look like the same exact photo, captured at the same moment, but with glamorous glitter eye makeup - editorial sparkle, embellished, luxuriously dramatic - nothing else altered.
