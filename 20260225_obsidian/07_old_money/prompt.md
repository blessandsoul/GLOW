- The person must remain 100% recognizable
- Makeup application only. No structural or anatomical modifications

Makeup transformation (Old Money Makeup)
- Perfectly blended muted neutral eyeshadow in soft taupe across the lid, slightly deeper in the crease
- Soft matte skin base with a satin finish - flawless but never shiny, never cakey
- Nude-rose lips in a creamy matte formula - understated, perfectly even, classic
- Groomed natural brows shaped impeccably but never drawn on - filled with light feathered strokes
- Subtle warm contour under cheekbones, blended invisibly for effortless bone structure
- Muted dusty rose blush, barely visible, placed high on cheekbones
- No shimmer, no glitter, no visible highlight - everything is matte-satin and refined
- Thin line of dark brown eyeliner on upper lash line, blended softly - no wing
- Natural-looking lashes - curled and separated, never dramatic or obviously false
- Overall impression: expensive, effortless, like she woke up this way

Hair handling (strictly no restyling)
- Keep the hairstyle identical in shape, length, volume, and part
- Only enhance realism: smooth flyaways, improve shine, refine natural texture
- No new bangs, no added layers, no volume change, no accessories

Lighting & finish
- Soft, warm, natural indoor lighting - like a well-lit sitting room in a manor house
- Maintain original shadow direction and contrast
- Makeup should interact naturally with existing light
- Ultra-realistic finish, high resolution
- No plastic skin, no over-smoothing, no stylization
- No added beauty filters or artificial glow overlays
- Maintain realism and photographic authenticity

Aesthetic direction
- Muted, refined, quietly expensive
- "She woke up this way" energy
- Understated wealth and effortless refinement
- Makeup should look invisible yet perfect, not AI-generated

Final result
The image should look like the same exact photo, captured at the same moment, but with old money makeup - muted, refined, quietly expensive - nothing else altered.
