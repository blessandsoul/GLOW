Use the uploaded image as the absolute, exact identity reference. Apply a luminous golden hour glow makeup transformation, while preserving everything else exactly as-is.

- Do NOT change camera angle, framing, pose, or crop
- Do NOT change background elements, environment, or composition

- No glam filter look
- The person must remain 100% recognizable
- Makeup application only. No structural or anatomical modifications

Makeup transformation (Golden Hour Glow Makeup)
- Warm peachy-gold tones across entire face mimicking sunset golden hour light on the skin
- Bronze shimmer on cheekbones - warm golden-bronze highlight that catches light in long stripes
- Warm golden shimmer eyeshadow washed across lids in a soft amber-peach, satin finish
- Warm coral blush blended on cheekbones - sun-warmed flush in a peachy-golden tone
- Honey-toned glossy lip - warm golden-nude with high-shine wet finish
- Skin base dewy and radiant with golden undertone - looks like actual golden hour is hitting the face
- Light golden highlight on nose bridge, forehead, and cupid's bow
- Brows natural and groomed, slightly warmed with golden-brown tones
- Lashes curled and coated in brown-black - warm, natural, sun-lit looking
- The entire face reads as if bathed in warm sunset light - cohesive warm golden palette

Hair handling (strictly no restyling)
- Keep the hairstyle identical in shape, length, volume, and part
- Only enhance realism: smooth flyaways, improve shine, refine natural texture
- No new bangs, no added layers, no volume change, no accessories

Lighting & finish
- Warm golden-hour directional light - the makeup enhances what golden hour naturally does
- Maintain original shadow direction and contrast
- Makeup should interact naturally with existing light
- Ultra-realistic finish, high resolution
- No plastic skin, no over-smoothing, no stylization
- No added beauty filters or artificial glow overlays
- Maintain realism and photographic authenticity

Aesthetic direction
- Sun-drenched, warm, radiant
- Golden hour on a beach energy
- Cohesive warm golden palette throughout
- Makeup should look like natural sunlight on skin, not AI-generated

Final result
The image should look like the same exact photo, captured at the same moment, but with golden hour glow makeup - sun-drenched, warm bronze, luminous golden radiance - nothing else altered.
