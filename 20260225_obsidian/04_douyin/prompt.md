Makeup transformation (Douyin White Peach Makeup)
- Soft peachy-pink flush concentrated on the center of face - cheeks, nose, and chin
- Aegyo-sal shimmer under eyes - fine champagne-pink glitter on the under-eye puff area
- Soft gradient coral lip with blurred edges - deeper coral at center fading to nothing at edges
- Dewy bright skin base - luminous, hydrated, with a youthful bounce and glow
- Light pink-peach eyeshadow wash across lids with a soft shimmer at center
- Straight, soft brows in a natural gray-brown - youthful and unstructured
- Single coat of curling mascara on upper lashes - cute, not dramatic
- Subtle highlight on nose bridge and under-eye area for brightening
- No contour - face is kept round and youthful, the peach flush provides dimension
- The overall effect is a "bitten peach" - fresh, juicy, innocently flushed

Hair handling (strictly no restyling)
- Keep the hairstyle identical in shape, length, volume, and part
- Only enhance realism: smooth flyaways, improve shine, refine natural texture
- No new bangs, no added layers, no volume change, no accessories

Lighting & finish
- Bright, clean, soft front lighting - fresh and youthful like a beauty app filter but realistic
- Maintain original shadow direction and contrast
- Makeup should interact naturally with existing light
- Ultra-realistic finish, high resolution
- No plastic skin, no over-smoothing, no stylization
- No added beauty filters or artificial glow overlays
- Maintain realism and photographic authenticity

Aesthetic direction
- Youthful, fresh, juicy
- "Bitten peach" K-beauty energy
- Innocent and dewy
- Makeup should look like a real-life beauty glow, not AI-generated

Final result
The image should look like the same exact photo, captured at the same moment, but with Douyin white peach makeup - peachy-flushed, dewy, youthfully bitten-peach sweet - nothing else altered.
