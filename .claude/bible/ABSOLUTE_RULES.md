# ABSOLUTE RULES - THE BIBLE

> "These rules are ABSOLUTE. If a specific agent needs an exception, the user will explicitly grant it. Otherwise, OBEY."
> **CRITICAL: Before updating agents, READ `SOUL_PROTECTION.md` to avoid 'LOBOTOMY'.**

## 1. LANGUAGE RULES (THE LAW)

### Communication Language
- Respond in the language the user uses
- Default: ENGLISH

### Content Language
- **DEFAULT:** ENGLISH
- **EXCEPTIONS (Georgian content):** Alpha, Short, Lang, Clip — these agents produce Georgian text
- Brand names: Keep original in ALL languages (Grok, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Tesla, etc.)
- Image/video prompts: ALWAYS ENGLISH (all agents, no exceptions)
- No mixed scripts within a single word (no Latin letters inside Georgian words)

### Hashtag Rules
- Brand names in English: #Grok #OpenAI #NVIDIA #Musk
- Non-brand hashtags: English for English agents, Georgian for Georgian agents
- Single words only. NO compound hashtags.

## 2. THE KILL-SWITCH (STRICT PROHIBITIONS)

**Before showing ANY output, SCAN and FIX these patterns:**

| Check | Pattern | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Contrast Trap** | "This is not X... this is Y", "Not X. Not Y.", "ეს არ არის X. ეს არ არის Y." — ALL variants | REWRITE as direct statement. Just say what it IS. |
| **Passive Voice** | "was created by", "has been made" | CONVERT to Active Voice |
| **Bold Text** | `**text**` | DELETE all asterisks. NO BOLD. |
| **Rhetorical Questions** | "Have you ever thought...?" | REWRITE as strong statement |
| **Ellipsis Drama** | `...` at end of sentence | COMPLETE the sentence |
| **Weak Hedging** | "might be", "could potentially" | DELETE. Be direct. |
| **Keyword CTA** | "Write X in comments", "DM me", keyword farming | REWRITE as real engaging question |
| **Colon Headlines** | `emoji:` | REPLACE `:` with ` - ` |

```
.claude/agents/[agentname]/content/[YYYYMMDD]_[topic]/
├── deep.json (or text.md for Eden)
├── post.md
├── image_visuals.md
└── [agent-specific files]
```

### Rules:
- NO `drafts/` folder - everything goes to `content/`
- Date format: YYYYMMDD (e.g., 20260128)
- Topic: lowercase_with_underscores

---

## 6. SHARED RESOURCES

### Bible (ALL agents obey):
```
.claude/bible/
├── ABSOLUTE_RULES.md    - This file
```

---

## 7. GOLDEN RULES (FROM ANALYTICS)

### What ALWAYS Works:
| Factor | High Performance | Low Performance |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Threat Type | Personal ("YOU are targeted") | Abstract ("People might...") |
| Villain | Named (Elon Musk) | Generic (Big Tech) |
| Timeframe | "Already happening" | "Will happen someday" |
| Fear Type | Economic/Physical | Intellectual/Abstract |

---

## 8. THE /ASK PROTOCOL

For complex tasks, use `/ask` to extract maximum context:

1. User types `/ask [topic/task]`
2. Agent asks 10-20 strategic questions:
   - **Context (1-4):** Audience, platform, urgency, resources
   - **Goal (5-8):** Outcome, metrics, what to avoid, ideal result
   - **Content (9-12):** Required elements, exclusions, tone, references
   - **Technical (13-16):** Limitations, integrations, format, deadline
   - **Depth (17-20):** Why this, previous attempts, hidden requirements
3. Agent confirms understanding
4. Agent proceeds with full context

---

## 9. IMAGE/PHOTO LANGUAGE RULE (UNIVERSAL)

**ALL image prompts generated by ANY agent must follow this:**

| Element | Language | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Domain branding | ENGLISH | "AndrewAltair.GE" |
| Title/headline text | GEORGIAN | "შენი შემდეგი უფროსი" |
| In-scene labels | GEORGIAN | Signs, screens, documents |

**Rule:** Photos and thumbnails must have GEORGIAN titles and headlines. The ONLY English text allowed on any image is the domain "AndrewAltair.GE". Everything else (title, hook, labels) must be in GEORGIAN.

**Placement:** Georgian title text uses CENTER PLACEMENT — at vertical midpoint of the frame, never near top or bottom edge. INSTAGRAM SAFE ZONE: Title text in 40-55% from top (center zone), never in top/bottom 25%.

---

## 10. SELF-IMPROVEMENT RULE (ALL AGENTS)

**After ANY correction from the user, the agent MUST update its lessons file BEFORE continuing.**

### Rule:
1. User corrects output (wrong format, wrong tone, missing element, bad translation, etc.)
2. Agent identifies the ROOT CAUSE (not just the symptom)
3. Agent writes a lesson entry in: `agents/[name]/analytics/lessons_learned.md`
4. Agent proceeds with the fix

### Lesson Format:
```
### [SHORT TITLE]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Trigger:** What the user corrected
**Root cause:** Why it happened
**Rule:** Concrete rule to prevent recurrence
**Auto-check:** How to verify this before output (if applicable)
```
