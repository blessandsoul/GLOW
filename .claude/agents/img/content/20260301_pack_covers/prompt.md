## Prompt 1 — OBSIDIAN

Extreme close-up of a cracked black volcanic obsidian rock surface filling the entire frame, deep jagged fractures cutting across the stone in irregular organic patterns, the rock faces between cracks are smooth and slightly concave with a matte charcoal-black finish, faint dark teal-green undertone visible in the deepest shadow areas, one hard directional side light raking from the upper right revealing every ridge and crack edge with sharp highlights while the crevices fall into pure black shadow, raw geological texture with micro-scratches and mineral grain visible on the flat planes, no text no letters no words no titles no watermarks, photorealistic macro photography, 1:1 square format.

## Prompt 2 — AMBER (RETOUCH)

Extreme macro view looking inside a piece of raw amber resin filling the entire frame, translucent golden honey and deep burnt orange tones with bright fiery yellow highlights, organic internal structures visible including tiny trapped air bubbles of varying sizes and thin branching vein-like inclusions running through the material, the surface has a polished wet-look gloss with sharp white light reflections streaking diagonally, areas of darker caramel and cognac brown create depth pockets while the thinnest sections glow with intense backlit warm gold, scattered micro-particles and fine organic debris suspended inside the resin, no text no letters no words no titles no watermarks, photorealistic macro photography, 1:1 square format.
