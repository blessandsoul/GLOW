## Prompt

A seamless horizontal strip of polished golden amber surface viewed from directly above, natural organic inclusions visible deep within the translucent honey-colored resin — tiny air bubbles, hairline fractures, and warm color gradients shifting from deep cognac to pale golden yellow, light passing through the stone creating rich warm depth and internal glow, the word AMBER in minimal recessed uppercase letters carved shallow into the polished surface with soft shadow, the carved letters have a slightly lighter warm gold tone against the deep honey base, continuous natural amber texture flowing left to right, tileable pattern, photorealistic fossilized resin detail, 750x50 pixel extreme horizontal banner format.
