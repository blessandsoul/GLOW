Create a studio photo of the uploaded product. PRESERVE: Product 100% identical — same shape, proportions, color, texture, logo, label, text. No redesign. RIBBON: [RIBBON_COLOR] satin ribbon physically spiraling around the product body in multiple wraps. Ribbon creates visible overlap and tension against the surface, naturally following the product shape. Smooth satin with glossy highlights. [RIBBON_WIDTH]. Ribbon does NOT float, does NOT look like a sticker. Top ribbon edge extends upward in a graceful free arc. Bottom ribbon gathers naturally in loops at the product base, touching the surface with gravity-driven curves. Ribbon realistically covers inscriptions where it wraps. COMPOSITION: Product centered vertically and horizontally, standing upright on clean surface. [BG_COLOR] background — clean, seamless studio, no textures or gradients. Soft professional studio lighting, clear highlights on satin ribbon, subtle highlights on product surface, gentle shadow underneath. QUALITY: Sharp focus, photorealistic — looks like a real studio product shoot with physically wrapped ribbon. 4:5 format, 8K quality.
