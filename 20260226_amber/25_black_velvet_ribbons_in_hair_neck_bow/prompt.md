Edit the uploaded photo as an ultra-realistic close-up portrait, high-fashion editorial. PRESERVE: Face identity 100% — exact 1:1 likeness. No changes to features, proportions, age, expression. Eyelashes and eyebrows completely fixed — no modification. No makeup changes. Original camera angle preserved, no crop changes, no zoom. SKIN: Ultra-detailed natural texture, visible pores, microtexture. Visible highlights and light reflections. Radiant wet glow, highly reflective editorial finish. No smoothing, no airbrushing. ADD: Black velvet ribbons (velvet texture, not satin) softly woven into hair. One velvet bow tied around neck. Ribbons lie naturally in place — no fluttering, no wind effect. SETUP: Hard high-contrast editorial lighting. Strong sculpted highlights, deep clear shadows. Additional back contour light for separation. Pure white studio background, solid, no color cast. Vogue-quality finish. 4:5 format, original dimensions.
