Skin: smooth, hydrated, and radiant. High-quality retouching reveals natural skin texture. Preserve pores and micro-details without blurring, eliminating the look of plastic surgery. Porcelain dewy base with lit-from-within luminosity, sheer coverage. Remove only minor blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing, no blur.
Makeup: Soft baby pink cream blush on apples of cheeks AND across nose bridge for innocent flush. Delicate rosy lip tint in pale ballet-pink, blotted for soft-stain finish. Pink shimmer on inner eye corners for wide-eyed sparkle. Soft pink-champagne shimmer dusted lightly across center of lids. Feathery wispy lashes, natural-looking but curled. Brows brushed up and softened with clear gel, natural, never harsh. Tiny dab of pink highlighter on cupid's bow and chin. No contour, no bronzer. Palette stays within pink-rose-champagne tones exclusively.
Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.
