Eyelashes must remain exactly as in the original photo.
DO NOT alter the shape, color, direction, or arch of eyebrows.

Skin: smooth, hydrated, and radiant. High-quality retouching reveals natural skin texture. Preserve pores and micro-details without blurring, eliminating the look of plastic surgery. Even skin tone with realistic highlights and a dewy glow. Remove only minor blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing, no blur.
Makeup: Soft smoky eyeshadow base in champagne and warm bronze tones, blended seamlessly with realistic gradient transitions. Fine reflective glitter layered lightly across eyelids, tasteful editorial sparkle, not chunky. Tiny rhinestone crystal accents placed at inner corners of both eyes. Full voluminous but realistic lashes aligned naturally to lash line. Lips in nude-pink satin shade with natural dimension, not overlined. Brows groomed and natural, keep original shape, slight definition only. No heavy foundation. No contour reshaping. Only the eye area is dramatically transformed. Palette: champagne-bronze-gold eye focus with neutral everything else.
Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.
