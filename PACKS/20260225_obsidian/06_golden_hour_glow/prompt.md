Dewy radiant base with warm golden undertone. Remove only minor blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing, no blur.
Makeup: Warm peachy-gold tones across face mimicking sunset golden hour light on skin. Bronze shimmer on cheekbones, warm golden-bronze highlight that catches light. Warm golden shimmer eyeshadow across lids in soft amber-peach, satin finish. Warm coral blush blended on cheekbones, sun-warmed peachy-golden flush. Honey-toned glossy lip, warm golden-nude with high-shine wet finish. Light golden highlight on nose bridge, forehead, and cupid's bow. Brows natural and groomed, slightly warmed with golden-brown tones. Lashes curled and coated in brown-black, warm and sun-lit looking. Entire face reads as bathed in warm sunset light, cohesive warm golden palette.
Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.
