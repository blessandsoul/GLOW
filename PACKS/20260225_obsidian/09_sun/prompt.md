Eye, eyelash, and eyebrow fixation:
DO NOT alter the eyes, eyelids, irises, sclera, or eye shape.
DO NOT alter the length, curl, thickness, direction, or style of eyelashes.
Eyelashes must remain exactly as in the original photo.
DO NOT alter the shape, color, direction, or arch of eyebrows.
Eyebrows must remain exactly as in the original photo.
Skin: preserve real skin texture with visible pores and micro-details fully visible. Dewy slightly oily-looking skin, like sunscreen and sun exposure combined. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing, no blur.
Makeup: Heavy warm coral-peach blush draped generously across nose bridge connecting both cheeks. Blush extends up to forehead and down to chin mimicking real sunburn pattern. Natural-looking freckles scattered across nose and cheeks in varying warm brown tones and sizes. Barely any other makeup — no eyeshadow, no liner, no visible foundation. Lips natural with just a hint of warm peach balm, slightly dry sun-exposed look. Brows natural, unfilled, slightly sun-bleached appearance. No contour. Warm peach-red tones only, no pink, no cool tones.
Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.
