Skin: smooth, hydrated, and radiant. High-quality retouching reveals natural skin texture. Preserve pores and micro-details without blurring, eliminating the look of plastic surgery. Dewy bright luminous base, hydrated with youthful glow. Remove only minor blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing, no blur.
Makeup: Soft peachy-pink flush concentrated on center of face — cheeks, nose, chin. Fine champagne-pink aegyo-sal shimmer on under-eye puff area. Soft gradient coral lip with blurred edges, deeper coral at center fading to nothing at edges. Light pink-peach eyeshadow wash across lids with soft shimmer at center. Straight soft brows in natural gray-brown, youthful and unstructured. Single coat of curling mascara on upper lashes, cute not dramatic. Subtle highlight on nose bridge and under-eye area for brightening. No contour. Overall "bitten peach" effect, fresh and juicy.
Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.
