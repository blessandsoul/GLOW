Skin: smooth, hydrated, and radiant. High-quality retouching reveals natural skin texture. Preserve pores and micro-details without blurring, eliminating the look of plastic surgery. Dewy petal-soft finish, luminous but not oily. Remove only minor blemishes. No plastic smoothing, no airbrushing, no blur.
Makeup: Soft diffused rose-pink blush across cheeks, blended widely and seamlessly. Blush extends slightly onto nose bridge for connected romantic flush. Matching rosy lip stain in true rose-pink shade, blotted for petal-soft matte finish. Pink shimmer eyeshadow on lids in soft rose-gold wash, barely there. Natural brows brushed up and softened, unfilled, delicate. Fine pink-champagne highlight on cheekbone peaks and inner eye corners. Light mascara in brown-black, soft feathery feminine lashes. No contour, no bronzer. Rose blush is the defining color and dimension. Everything in the pink-rose family, no warm oranges or cool purples.
Hair: keep identical. Only smooth flyaways and improve shine.
