Get high-quality professional skin retouching for editorial beauty photography. Don't resize your photos.
Skin should appear smooth, radiant, and healthy, with a natural glow, while remaining completely photorealistic.
Carefully remove minor skin imperfections such as small blemishes, pimples, temporary redness, and age spots, fully preserving natural skin texture, micro-details, and the effect of radiant, detailed, and glowing skin.
Preserve realistic skin texture and visible pores—without blurring, smearing, soft focus, noise reduction, airbrushing, plastic, or artificial anti-aliasing. Preserve crisp micro-contrast, sharp focus, and high-frequency detail at the pixel level.
Enhance skin using subtle highlights and sculpted light reflections to enhance natural contours, bone structure, and volume. Create sophisticated, glossy editorial highlights that add depth and dimension without creating a greasy or artificial effect.

Preserve and enhance microtexture and high-frequency detail: Visible pores, fine lines, vellus hair, and natural skin texture should remain crisp and authentic. Add subtle natural skin texture only when necessary to enhance realism.
Keep freckles and all natural skin details intact.
Add a small number of subtle, natural-looking microfreckles, realistically distributed across the skin, to enhance authenticity. Freckles should appear delicate, barely noticeable, and completely photorealistic, blending seamlessly with the natural skin texture.

DO NOT alter the appearance in any way: facial features, shape, proportions, age, and overall appearance should remain exactly the same.

Eyebrows are an absolutely protected and completely excluded area. They are completely masked from processing and must remain 100% identical to the original image without any intervention. Retouching tools, adjustments, lighting, contrast, sharpening, color correction, or any global or local changes should NEVER affect this area. Under no circumstances should you touch, alter, enhance, clean, separate, define, darken, lighten, thicken, lengthen, change shape, color, style, or manipulate them. This area must remain completely untouched at the pixel level with absolute integrity.

❗️ DO NOT alter the eyes, eyelids, eyebrows, or lips.
Retouch ONLY the skin. Clear and even skin tone, soft, flattering light, a healthy, natural glow, highlights, sculpted volume, preserved pores, pronounced microtexture, sharp high-frequency detail, no blur, and no anti-aliasing artifacts.
Replace the background with a beautiful white one.
