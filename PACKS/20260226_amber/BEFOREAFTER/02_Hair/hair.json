  "prompt": "Realistic smartphone selfie of a young woman, mid-20s, light warm skin tone, brown hair. Showing her hair from the side and back. The hair is perfect — freshly done at the salon: beautiful rich color, gorgeous soft waves, incredible shine and volume, flawless balayage. Professional stylist work. But the rest is raw and unedited: skin on the face and neck has normal imperfections, slightly uneven tone, no foundation. Minimal makeup — just mascara. Wearing a plain simple t-shirt. Photo taken on iPhone in a regular apartment, standing near a window. Natural daylight from the left side, no reflector, no professional lighting. Plain light grey wall behind. Phone camera quality — sharp enough but flat, no depth, the beautiful hair shine doesn't pop the way it should. Completely unedited, no filters. The perfect hair deserves better than this photo. 4:5 format."
