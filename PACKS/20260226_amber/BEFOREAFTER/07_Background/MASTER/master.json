  "prompt": "Edit the uploaded photo — professional editorial retouch with background enhancement. PRESERVE: Face identity 100% identical — one-to-one likeness. No changes to facial features, proportions, age, expression. Original camera angle, crop, framing preserved — no zoom, no perspective shift. EYELASHES: Pixel-identical — exact original, no modification whatsoever. Density 100% unchanged. EYEBROWS: Exact original shape, thickness, color, texture — no changes. LIPS: Unchanged. HAIR: Preserve original color, texture, position, shine. Enhance texture and shine through lighting only — no structural changes. MAKEUP: Unchanged — preserve all existing application. Eyes and makeup: fully locked. SKIN: Ultra-detailed natural texture — visible pores, microtexture, natural imperfections preserved. Remove only minor blemishes (redness, spots). Smooth, hydrated, radiant with dewy glow. Even skin tone. Subtle professional retouch — blemishes only. Editorial shine effect. No airbrushing, no plastic. Beautiful catchlight on iris. Subtle natural freckles preserved if present. Highlighter effect on cheeks and nose tip. BACKGROUND: Dramatic studio backdrop — deep moody teal-to-black gradient with cinematic warm highlights bleeding from one side. Soft volumetric haze creating atmosphere and depth. A few blurred warm bokeh orbs floating in the background. Feels like a Vogue cover shoot or high-end beauty campaign by Tom Ford. LIGHTING: Hard high-contrast editorial studio lighting. Sculptural highlights on cheekbones, temples, shoulders. Cinematic rim/backlight from behind for depth and sculpted volume. Rim light on shoulders, hair, facial contour. High-contrast studio look. Vogue-level finish. QUALITY: Preserve original color correction, no filters. Ultra-photorealistic fashion photography. Sharp focus. 8K quality. Original dimensions — do not crop or resize."
