  "prompt": "Realistic smartphone selfie of a young woman, mid-20s, light warm skin tone, brown hair. Full upper body portrait. She looks great — nice makeup, styled hair, pretty outfit, ready to go out. The woman herself is the star. But the background is terrible: she is standing in a regular apartment near a window. Natural daylight from the left side, no reflector, no professional lighting. Plain light grey wall behind with a light switch visible and the edge of a door frame. Flat, boring, zero atmosphere. Phone front camera quality — slight wide-angle distortion, everything in focus including the ugly background, no bokeh separation. The woman deserves a beautiful studio backdrop or creative setting, not this apartment wall. Completely unedited, no filters. 4:5 format."
