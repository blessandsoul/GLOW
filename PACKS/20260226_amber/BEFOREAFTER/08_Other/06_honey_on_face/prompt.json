  "prompt": "Edit the uploaded photo. PRESERVE: Face identity 100% identical — all facial features unchanged. Eyelashes and eyebrows exactly as original — no modification to shape, color, or texture. SKIN: Smooth, hydrated, radiant with visible pores. Even skin tone, dewy glow, remove redness only. ADD: Yellow honey streaks dripping naturally down the face, as if real honey is flowing over the skin. Honey should have realistic viscosity, transparency, and light refraction. BACKGROUND: Clean beautiful white. QUALITY: Preserve original color correction, no filters. Sharp focus. Original dimensions."
