  "prompt": "Realistic smartphone selfie of a young woman, mid-20s, light warm skin tone, brown hair. Straight-on face portrait. She has a pretty face and nice natural features — pleasant expression, clear eyes, good bone structure. But the photo is completely plain: no makeup or barely any, natural unretouched skin, hair simply down without styling. No accessories, no decoration, no creative elements at all. Just a basic everyday selfie. Photo taken on iPhone in a regular apartment, standing near a window. Natural daylight from the left side, no reflector, no professional lighting. Plain light grey wall behind. Phone camera quality — sharp enough but flat, no depth, no color grading. She is a beautiful blank canvas — great potential but zero creative treatment. Completely unedited, no filters. The face is there, it just needs artistic transformation. 4:5 format."
