  "prompt": "Edit the uploaded photo — professional editorial beauty retouch. PRESERVE: Face identity 100% identical — all facial features, eyes, lips, expression, skin tone unchanged. No changes to proportions, age, or any facial characteristic. EYELASHES: Pixel-identical — absolutely protected, no interaction of any kind. EYEBROWS: Pixel-identical — no modification to shape, color, density, texture. LIPS: Unchanged — no color, shape, or texture modification. HAIR: Unchanged — preserve all texture, position, shine. MAKEUP: Unchanged — preserve all existing application exactly. SKIN: Professional editorial retouch. Smooth, hydrated, radiant with visible pores. Natural texture preserved — micro-details, vellus hair intact. Even skin tone, dewy glow. Remove only minor blemishes (redness, acne, spots). Hydrated editorial glow with subtle highlights. Beautiful catchlight on iris. Micro-contrast enhanced for realistic depth. No plastic effect, no smoothing, no blurring, no airbrushing. BACKGROUND: Soft dreamy gradient from dusty mauve to warm champagne gold — ethereal, artistic, editorial. Gentle soft-focus light flares and tiny bokeh particles creating a magical atmosphere. Feels like a premium beauty editorial in Dazed or i-D magazine. QUALITY: Preserve original color correction, no filters. Professional studio quality, ultra-photorealistic. Sharp focus. 8K quality. Original dimensions — do not crop or resize."
