  "prompt": "Realistic smartphone selfie of a young woman, mid-20s, light warm skin tone, brown hair. Close-up focused on the lower face and lips. The lips are perfect — freshly done by a professional: flawless contour, rich even nude-pink color, smooth hydrated surface, beautiful natural shape. The lip work is stunning. But the rest is raw and unedited: skin around the mouth has a couple small blemishes, slightly uneven tone on the chin, visible pores on the cheeks. Minimal makeup — just mascara. Hair falling loosely, not styled. Photo taken on iPhone in a regular apartment, standing near a window. Natural daylight from the left side, no reflector, no professional lighting. Plain light grey wall behind. Phone camera quality — sharp enough but flat, no depth, no color grading. Completely unedited, no filters. The perfect lips deserve better than this photo. 4:5 format."
