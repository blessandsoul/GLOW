  "prompt": "Realistic smartphone selfie of a young woman, mid-20s, light warm skin tone, brown hair. Close-up of her eye area. The lashes are perfect — freshly done professional eyelash extensions: flawless density, beautiful curl, even length, gorgeous volume set. The lash master did incredible work. But the rest is raw and unedited: skin around the eyes is natural — slight dark circles, normal texture, no concealer. Eyebrows groomed but not filled in. No eye makeup except the extensions. Photo taken on iPhone in a regular apartment, standing near a window. Natural daylight from the left side, no reflector, no professional lighting. Plain light grey wall behind. Phone camera quality — sharp enough but can't capture the individual lash fibers in true macro detail. Completely unedited, no filters. The stunning lash extensions deserve professional macro photography, not this phone snap. 1:1 format."
