  "prompt": "Realistic smartphone selfie of a young woman, mid-20s, light warm skin tone, brown hair. Close-up of her face. The skin is the focus — she just had a professional facial treatment: deeply cleansed, hydrated, smooth, pores minimized, calm and healthy base. The cosmetologist did great work. But the photo hides it: taken on iPhone in a regular apartment, standing near a window. Natural daylight from the left side, no reflector, no professional lighting — the healthy glow doesn't read well in flat phone light. No makeup at all, completely bare face post-treatment. Hair loosely pulled back. Plain light grey wall behind. Phone camera quality — sharp enough but flat, no depth, slightly washed out colors. The skin looks okay but not as amazing as it does in person. Completely unedited, no filters. The professional skin work deserves editorial lighting to truly show the result. 4:5 format."
