  "prompt": "Edit the uploaded photo — skin retouch ONLY. PRESERVE: Face identity 100% — one-to-one likeness. No changes to facial features, proportions, age, expression. Eyelashes: pixel-identical to original — no change to length, curl, density, direction, thickness. Eyebrows: pixel-identical to original — no change to shape, thickness, density, color, position. Lips: unchanged. Hair: unchanged. Makeup: unchanged. Original camera angle, crop, framing preserved. SKIN: Remove only temporary imperfections (blemishes, redness, minor discoloration). Preserve natural texture, pores, micro-details, fine lines. Even skin tone, natural luminosity, healthy glow — not oily or artificial. Subtle micro-contrast for realistic depth. No plastic, no blur, no airbrush, no waxy surface. STRICT: Do not change skin color, tone, temperature, or undertone. No color grading applied to skin. No white balance shifts. Skin hue, saturation, luminance must remain identical to original. QUALITY: Preserve original color correction, no filters. Vogue-level editorial finish. 4:5 format, original dimensions."
