  "prompt": "Realistic smartphone selfie of a young woman, mid-20s, light warm skin tone, brown hair. Upper body shot showing neck and shoulders. She is wearing beautiful accessories — elegant gold earrings, a delicate layered necklace, a nice bracelet. The jewelry is gorgeous and high quality. But the rest is raw and unedited: skin on the neck and décolleté is normal, slightly uneven tone, no retouch. Wearing a simple plain top. Hair loosely down, not styled for a shoot. Photo taken on iPhone in a regular apartment, standing near a window. Natural daylight from the left side, no reflector, no professional lighting — the gold doesn't catch light and sparkle the way it should. Plain light grey wall behind. Phone camera quality — sharp enough but flat, the fine jewelry details aren't captured well. Completely unedited, no filters. The beautiful accessories deserve fashion editorial lighting, not this. 4:5 format."
