  "prompt": "Realistic smartphone photo taken by a young woman, mid-20s, light warm skin tone. Close-up of her hand held up near her face. The nails are perfect — fresh gel manicure: flawless smooth finish, even nude-pink color, clean cuticle line, beautiful almond shape, glossy professional result. The nail master did an amazing job. But the rest is raw and unedited: hand skin is normal — natural texture, not moisturized for the photo. Face slightly visible in the background, blurry, no makeup. Photo taken on iPhone in a regular apartment, standing near a window. Natural daylight from the left side, no reflector, no professional lighting. Plain light grey wall behind. Phone camera quality — sharp enough but flat, the beautiful gel shine isn't captured the way it looks in real life. Completely unedited, no filters. The perfect manicure deserves better than this photo. 4:5 format."
