Studio Setup: • Harsh, high-contrast editorial studio lighting • Sculpted highlights on cheekbones, temples, and shoulders • Clean studio backdrop or minimalist fashion background
Skin: • Ultra-detailed, hyper-realistic skin texture • Professional, subtle skin retouching: removing only minor blemishes and imperfections • Preserving natural pores, microtexture, and realistic skin texture • Healthy, even skin tone with natural depth of color • A radiant, patent leather effect, just like in an editorial shoot • No over-smoothing, no airbrushing, no plastic look
Accessories: • Minimal pearl stud earrings • Statement, layered pearl necklace • Clean, elegant, high-end jewelry aesthetic
Hair: • Maintaining the original structure of the hair • Enhanced texture and shine through lighting alone • No alteration to the hair
Mood and Quality: • Luxurious fashion editorial photography • Powerful, confident, sculpted beauty • Ultra-photorealistic look • 8K resolution • Magazine-grade quality, like Vogue
STRICTLY DISADVANTAGES: No face contouring, no eye contour enhancement, no eyelash extensions, no soft glam makeup, no blur effect, no fantasy look.
