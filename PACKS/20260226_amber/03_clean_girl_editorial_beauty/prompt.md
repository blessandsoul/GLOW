Create an ultra-realistic beauty portrait using my uploaded photo as the only reference.
ABSOLUTE RULE: The face must remain 100% identical to the reference. Do NOT change facial structure, proportions, eyes, nose, lips, jawline, cheekbones, skin tone, or expression in any way.
Facial features — strictly locked: • Eyebrows: keep EXACT original shape, density, color, arch, and position. No redesign, no enhancement, no thinning or thickening. • Eyelashes: HARD LOCK. Keep EXACT original length, curl pattern, color, and ORIGINAL DENSITY — density must remain 100% unchanged. No added volume, no reduction, no mascara effect, no extension look, no density alteration of any kind. • Eyes: identical size, shape, spacing, and natural detail. • Lips: identical shape, volume, and natural texture.
Hair: Straight, loose, brushed back, natural volume, same color as reference. No headwear, towels, jewelry, or accessories.
