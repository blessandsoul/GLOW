## Prompt

A seamless horizontal strip of polished golden amber surface viewed from directly above, natural organic inclusions visible deep within the translucent honey-colored resin — tiny air bubbles, hairline fractures, and warm color gradients shifting from deep cognac to pale golden yellow, light passing through the stone creating rich warm depth and internal glow, continuous natural amber texture flowing left to right, tileable pattern, photorealistic fossilized resin detail, no text, no letters, no words, no watermarks, pure texture only, 750x50 pixel extreme horizontal banner format.
