Portrait photography, the aesthetics of natural spring beauty. A close-up portrait with radiant, healthy skin, soft freckles, minimal natural makeup, and glossy lips. Maintain all facial proportions. Do not alter the face. Eye, eyelash, and eyebrow fixation: DO NOT alter the eyes, eyelids, irises, sclera, or eye shape. DO NOT alter the length, curl, thickness, direction, or style of eyelashes. Eyelashes must remain exactly as in the original photo. DO NOT alter the shape, color, direction, or arch of eyebrows. Eyebrows must remain exactly as in the original photo. Fresh green small roses intertwined with hair and partially covering the face, an organic floral arrangement. Soft natural studio lighting, subtle shadows, highly detailed skin, realistic texture, and a wet skin effect. Create a beautiful catchlight on the iris. A clean, editorial beauty style, shallow depth of field, pastel green tones, and an earthy color palette. Replace the background with a beautiful black one. Upgrade your photo to 8K. Professional beauty photography, no harsh retouching, reveals pores.
