Create high-quality professional skin retouching for editorial beauty photography. Do not resize photos.
Skin must appear completely photorealistic.
Preserve realistic skin texture and visible pores—without blurring, smearing, soft focus, noise reduction, airbrushing, plastic, or artificial smoothing. Maintain crisp microcontrast, sharp focus, and high-frequency detail at the pixel level.
Create sophisticated, glossy accents for photoshoots that add depth and dimension without creating a greasy or artificial effect.

Preserve facial microtexture: visible pores, fine lines, vellus hair, and natural skin texture must remain crisp and authentic.

DO NOT alter your appearance in any way: facial features, makeup, shape, proportions, age, and overall appearance must remain exactly the same.

Makeup and the face are absolutely protected and completely excluded. It is completely masked for processing and must remain 100% identical to the original image without any modifications. Retouching tools, adjustments, lighting, contrast, sharpening, color correction, or any global or local changes should NEVER touch this area. Under no circumstances should it be touched, altered, enhanced, cleaned, separated, defined, darkened, lightened, thickened, lengthened, reshaped, colored, styled, or manipulated. This area must remain completely untouched at the pixel level with absolute integrity. Do not alter facial contrast.

❗️ DO NOT alter the eyes, eyelids, eyebrows, or lips.
Retouch ONLY the skin. A clear and even skin tone, soft, attractive light, a healthy, natural glow, highlights, sculpted volume, preserved pores, pronounced microtexture, clear high-frequency details, and the absence of blurring and anti-aliasing artifacts.
Replace the background with a beautiful white one.
