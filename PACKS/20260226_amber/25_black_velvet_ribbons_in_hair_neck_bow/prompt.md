A high-fashion studio sculpting photoshoot dedicated to beauty. Preserving the original face precisely – a precise portrait. No changes to facial features, proportions, age, or expression. Eye, eyelash, and eyebrow capture. DO NOT alter the eyes, eyelids, irises, sclera, or eye shape. DO NOT alter eyebrows, brow color, arch, thickness, or direction. Eyelashes and eyebrows must remain exactly as in the original photograph. Angle and framing capture: Preserve the original angle, framing, and composition precisely. No zooming, no changing perspective. Stylization is applied ONLY through lighting, environment, and skin texture. Studio Setup: • Hard, high-contrast editorial studio lighting • Sculpted highlights on cheekbones, temples, and shoulders • Clean studio backdrop or minimalist fashion backdrop Skin: • Ultra-detailed, hyper-realistic skin texture • Visible pores, microtexture, and natural imperfections • Editorial-style shine, patent leather look • No smoothing, no airbrushing, no plastic look Hair: • Beautiful, voluminous, elegant curly hair • Natural, flowing locks with sophisticated styling for a fashion editorial shoot • Hair color must closely match the original photograph • Enhanced shine and texture through lighting alone • No fancy colors, no artificial colors Mood & Quality: • Luxurious fashion editorial • Powerful, confident, sculpted beauty • Ultra-photorealistic look • 8K resolution • Magazine-grade quality, like Vogue Replace Satin black background. STRICT EXCEPTION: no accessories, no jewelry, no retouching, no facial contouring, no eye modification, no eyelash replacement, no soft glamour, no blurring, no fantasy look
