Perform high-quality professional skin retouching for editorial beauty photos. Do not resize photos.
In natural light, the skin should look smooth, radiant and healthy, while remaining completely photorealistic.
Gently removes minor skin blemishes such as small pimples, blackheads, temporary redness and age spots, completely preserving the natural skin texture, the smallest details and the effect of radiant skin.
Maintain realistic skin texture and visible pores — without blurring, smudging, soft focus, noise reduction, air bristles, plastic or artificial smoothing. Maintain clear microhardness, sharp focus, and high-frequency pixel detail.
Create natural contours, bone structure, and volume. Create exquisite glossy highlights that will add depth and volume to the skin without greasy or artificial effect.

Preserve and emphasize the details: visible pores, fine wrinkles, and the natural texture of the skin should remain clear and authentic. Add a subtle natural skin texture only if necessary to enhance the realism.
Save your freckles and all the natural features of your skin.
Accentuate the contour of your lips with concealer without changing their shape. 
The lips are fully protected, and problem areas are completely excluded. They are completely hidden from processing and must remain 100% identical to the original image without any interference. Retouching tools, lighting settings, contrast, sharpness, color correction, or any global or local changes should not affect this area in any way. Under no circumstances should you change the color, tone, saturation, or shape of your lips, emphasize them, remove them, separate them, highlight them, outline them, tighten them, thicken them, lengthen them, shape them, tint them, apply them, or manipulate them. This area should remain completely unmanageable at the pixel level with absolute security. Add 5 small silver metallic rhinestones in the shape of hearts to your upper lip.
Make the image as realistic as possible. 
Replace the background with a beautiful black one.
