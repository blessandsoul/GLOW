Perform high-end professional skin retouching for an editorial beauty photograph.
The skin should appear smooth, radiant, and healthy with a natural glow while remaining completely photorealistic.
Carefully remove minor skin imperfections such as small blemishes, pimples, temporary redness, and pigmentation spots while fully preserving natural skin texture, micro-detail, and the effect of luminous, detailed, glowing skin.
Preserve realistic skin texture and visible pores — absolutely no blurring, no smearing, no soft-focus, no denoise, no airbrushing, no plastic or artificial smoothing. Maintain crisp micro-contrast, sharp focus, and high-frequency detail at pixel level.
Enhance the skin using subtle specular highlights and sculptural light reflections to emphasize natural contours, bone structure, and dimensionality. Create refined glossy editorial highlights that add depth and volume without looking oily or artificial.
Preserve and enhance micro texture and high frequency detail: visible pores, fine lines, peach fuzz, and natural skin grain must remain sharp and authentic. Add subtle natural skin texture only if needed to increase realism.
Keep freckles and all natural skin details fully intact.
Add a small amount of subtle, natural-looking micro freckles distributed realistically across the skin to enhance authenticity. The freckles must appear delicate, barely noticeable, and fully photorealistic, blending seamlessly with the natural skin texture.
❗️Do NOT alter the appearance in any way: facial features, shape, proportions, age, and overall look must remain exactly the same.
❗️Eyelashes are an absolutely protected and completely excluded area. They are fully masked from processing and must remain 100% identical to the original capture with ZERO interaction. Retouching tools, adjustments, lighting, contrast, sharpening, color grading, or any global or local edits must NEVER affect this region in any way. Do not touch, modify, enhance, clean, separate, define, darken, brighten, thicken, lengthen, reshape, recolor, restyle, or process them under any circumstances. This area must remain completely untouched at the pixel level with absolute invariance.
❗️Do NOT modify the eyes, eyelids, eyebrows, or lips.
Retouch ONLY the skin.
