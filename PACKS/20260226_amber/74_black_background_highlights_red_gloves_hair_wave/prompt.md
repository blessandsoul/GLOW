Create high-quality professional skin retouching for editorial beauty photography. Do not change the size of the photos.
The skin should look completely photorealistic.
Maintain realistic skin texture and visible pores — without blurring, smudging, soft focus, noise reduction, airbrushing, plastic, or artificial smoothing. Add a wet highlight to the skin of the face, neck and collarbone. Maintain a clear micro-contrast pattern, sharp focus, and high-frequency pixel-level detail.
Create exquisite glossy accents for photo shoots that add depth and volume without creating a bright or artificial effect.

Preserve the microtexture of the face: visible pores, fine wrinkles, fluffy hair and natural skin texture should remain clear and authentic.

In any case, do not change your appearance: your facial features, makeup, figure, proportions, age and general appearance should remain exactly the same.

Eyebrows and eyelashes are absolutely protected and completely excluded. During processing, they are completely masked and must remain 100% identical to the original image without any changes. Retouching, correction, lighting, contrast, sharpening, color correction, or any global or local changes should not affect this area. Under no circumstances should it be touched, altered, improved, cleaned, separated, highlighted, darkened, lightened, thickened, lengthened, shaped, colored, stylized, or manipulated. This area should remain completely untouched at the pixel level, maintaining absolute integrity. Do not change the contrast of the face.

DO NOT change the color of your eyes, eyelids, eyebrows, or lips.
Retouch ONLY the skin. Clean and even skin tone, soft, attractive light, healthy, natural radiance, glare, sculptural volume, narrowed pores, pronounced microtexture, clear high-frequency details and the absence of artifacts of blurring and smoothing.
