Create an ultra-realistic beauty portrait using my uploaded photo as a reference. Keep the original face 100% identical – do not change facial features, proportions, eyes, nose, lips, skin texture, or facial expression.
Replace the headdress with a soft pink terry towel wrapped around the head (spa-style), no logos, text, or embroidery. Remove any text or branding (no "Rhode").
Skin: • Ultra-detailed, hyper-realistic skin texture • Visible pores, microtexture, natural imperfections • High radiance, patent leather effect • No smoothing, no airbrushing, no plastic effect
Natural freckles, glowing, hydrated skin with visible pores and realistic skin texture. Add soft pink hydrogel eye patches, translucent and glossy. Eye, eyelash, and eyebrow fixation:
DO NOT alter the eyes, eyelids, irises, sclera, or eye shape.
DO NOT alter the length, curl, thickness, direction, or style of eyelashes.
Eyelashes must remain exactly as in the original photo.
DO NOT alter the shape, color, direction, or arch of eyebrows.
Eyebrows must remain exactly as in the original photo.
Clean white studio background, soft, diffused light, high-quality editorial beauty photography. Photorealistic, high-quality image, sharp focus, no blur, no facial smoothing.
